# Highlights

 -  The Auditory Cortex ResNet, briefly AUCO ResNet, is proposed and
   tested. It is a deep neural network architecture especially designed
   for audio classification trained end-to-end. It is inspired by the
   architectural organization of rat's auditory cortex, containing also
   innovations 2 and 3. The network outperforms the state-of-the-art
   accuracies on a reference audio benchmark dataset without any kind of
   preprocessing, imbalanced data handling and, most importantly, any
   kind of data augmentation.
   
   
 - A trainable Mel-like spectrogram layer able to finetune the   
   Mel-like-Spectrogram for capturing relevant time frequency   
   information.


 - A novel sinusoidal learnable attention mechanism which can be   
   considered as a technique to weight local and global feature   
   descriptors focusing on high frequency details.


 - State of the art cross-dataset testing and related accuracies.
